  "prTitle": "feat: create main build orchestration script",
  "prBody": "## Summary\n\nImplemented the main build orchestration script (`build/build.js`) that serves as the central entry point for coordinating all build steps in the correct order.\n\n### Key Features Implemented\n\n**Phase-Based Build Process:**\n- **Phase 1**: Clean `dist/` directory before each build\n- **Phase 2**: Run markdown compilation and image optimization in parallel for improved performance\n- **Phase 3**: Execute CSS bundling and critical CSS generation sequentially after content processing\n\n**Error Handling & CI/CD Integration:**\n- Comprehensive error aggregation with detailed logging\n- Proper exit codes (0 for success, 1 for failure) for CI/CD pipelines\n- Graceful handling of missing dependency scripts with warnings\n\n**Build Monitoring:**\n- Real-time logging with timestamps and severity levels\n- Complete build statistics (total/completed/failed/skipped tasks)\n- Total build time measurement and reporting\n- Detailed error summary with troubleshooting information\n\n**Robust Architecture:**\n- Object-oriented design with `BuildOrchestrator` class\n- Modular script execution with proper process management\n- Support for both direct execution and module import\n- Comprehensive file existence checking before script execution\n\n### Technical Implementation\n\nThe script orchestrates the following dependency order:\n1. **Prerequisites**: Requires tasks 3-6 (individual build scripts)\n2. **Cleanup**: Removes and recreates `dist/` directory\n3. **Parallel Content**: `compile-markdown.js` + `optimize-images.js`\n4. **Sequential CSS**: `bundle-css.js` → `generate-critical-css.js`\n\n### Testing Completed\n\n✅ **Success Path**: All scripts execute successfully with proper logging\n✅ **Error Handling**: Failed scripts properly trigger build failure with exit code 1\n✅ **Missing Dependencies**: Graceful handling with warnings when scripts don't exist\n✅ **Directory Management**: Proper `dist/` cleanup and recreation\n✅ **Statistics Logging**: Comprehensive build summary with timing and task counts\n\nCloses #7",
