# Feeding Your Donkey

Proper nutrition is essential for maintaining your donkey's health and wellbeing. Donkeys have different dietary needs compared to horses, and understanding these differences is crucial.

## Basic Nutritional Needs

### Primary Diet Components

1. **Forage** (80-90% of diet)
   - High-quality grass hay
   - Pasture grass (limited for overweight donkeys)
   - Avoid alfalfa hay (too rich)

2. **Water**
   - 5-10 gallons per day
   - Fresh, clean water always available
   - Check water sources daily

3. **Supplements** (if needed)
   - Salt block or loose salt
   - Minerals specific to your region
   - Vitamin supplements in poor pasture conditions

## Feeding Guidelines

### Daily Amounts
- **Hay**: 1.5-3% of body weight
- **Concentrate**: Usually unnecessary for healthy donkeys
- **Treats**: Limited to small amounts

### Feeding Schedule
```
Morning: 50% of daily hay ration
Evening: 50% of daily hay ration
Treats: Occasional, small portions
```

## Foods to Avoid

⚠️ **Never feed these to donkeys:**
- Chocolate
- Avocado
- Lawn clippings
- Moldy or dusty feed
- Large amounts of grain
- Sugary treats

## Weight Management

Donkeys are efficient at maintaining weight and can easily become overweight. Signs of obesity include:
- Cresty neck
- Fat deposits along the back
- Difficulty seeing ribs

## Special Considerations

- **Older donkeys**: May need softer hay or soaked feed
- **Pregnant/lactating jennets**: Increased nutritional needs
- **Working donkeys**: May require additional calories

Remember: When in doubt, consult with a veterinarian familiar with donkey care!
