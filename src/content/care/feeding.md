important_warning: "Never feed donkeys chocolate, avocado, or any moldy feed. These can be toxic and potentially fatal. Always consult a veterinarian before making major dietary changes."

quick_tips:
  - "Donkeys need 1.5-2% of their body weight in dry matter daily"
  - "Access to clean, fresh water is essential - up to 30 liters per day"
  - "Feed little and often rather than large meals"
  - "Monitor body condition regularly using a body scoring system"

    title: "Hay & Forage"
    introduction: "Quality forage forms the foundation of a donkey's diet. Understanding different types of hay and forage options is crucial for maintaining optimal health."
    content: |
      Donkeys are efficient at extracting nutrients from poor-quality forage, which can sometimes work against them in modern management. Their digestive system is designed for low-quality, high-fiber vegetation.

      The best forage for donkeys is typically **barley straw** or **meadow hay**. These provide adequate nutrition without being too rich, which can lead to obesity and laminitis.

      - term: "Daily Hay Requirements"
        definition: "1.5-2% of body weight in dry matter per day (8-12 kg for average 400kg donkey)"
      - term: "Best Hay Types"
        definition: "Barley straw, meadow hay, timothy hay - avoid rich alfalfa"
      - term: "Storage Requirements"
        definition: "Keep hay dry, well-ventilated, and off the ground to prevent mold"

        title: "Assessing Hay Quality"
        content: |
          Good quality hay should be:
          - Sweet smelling and free from mustiness
          - Green or golden in color (not brown or black)
          - Free from dust, mold, or foreign objects
          - Soft to touch with a good leaf-to-stem ratio

          Poor quality indicators include:
          - Musty or sour smell
          - Excessive dust when handled
          - Black or brown patches (mold)
          - Excessive weeds or foreign plants

        care_items:
          - term: "Visual Inspection"
            definition: "Check color, look for mold spots, assess overall condition"
          - term: "Smell Test"
            definition: "Good hay smells sweet and fresh, never musty or fermented"
          - term: "Touch Test"
            definition: "Should feel dry and crisp, not damp or slimy"

      - id: "seasonal-feeding"
        title: "Seasonal Considerations"
        content: |
          Feeding requirements change throughout the year based on weather, grass growth, and the donkey's condition.

          **Spring:** Fresh grass growth can be very rich. Limit access to prevent laminitis.
          **Summer:** Provide shade and ensure constant water access. Grass may be poor quality in drought.
          **Autumn:** Good grazing season but monitor for autumn grass flush.
          **Winter:** Increase hay provision as grass quality decreases.

    tips:
      - "Introduce any new hay gradually over 7-10 days"
      - "Store different hay batches separately to track quality"
      - "Test hay nutritionally if you're unsure about quality"
      - "Consider soaking hay for donkeys prone to laminitis"

    warnings:
      - title: "Moldy Hay Warning"
        content: "Never feed moldy or dusty hay. It can cause serious respiratory problems and colic."

  - id: "concentrates-supplements"
    title: "Concentrates & Supplements"
    introduction: "While forage should form the majority of a donkey's diet, some situations may require additional concentrates or supplements."
    content: |
      Most donkeys in good condition with access to quality forage do **not** require additional concentrates. However, certain circumstances may warrant supplemental feeding.

    care_items:
      - term: "When to Supplement"
        definition: "Pregnancy, lactation, old age, poor body condition, or limited forage quality"
      - term: "Concentrate Amount"
        definition: "Maximum 0.5% of body weight daily (2kg for 400kg donkey)"
      - term: "Suitable Concentrates"
        definition: "Donkey-specific feeds, sugar beet pulp, or low-energy horse feeds"

    subsections:
      - id: "body-condition-scoring"
        title: "Body Condition Scoring"
        content: |
          Regular body condition scoring helps determine if your donkey needs additional feed. Use a scale of 1-5:

          - **Score 1:** Very poor - ribs, spine, and hip bones prominent
          - **Score 2:** Poor - ribs easily felt, minimal fat cover
          - **Score 3:** Good - ribs just covered, well-rounded appearance
          - **Score 4:** Fat - ribs hard to feel, obvious fat deposits
          - **Score 5:** Very fat - deep fat deposits, difficult to feel ribs

          Target condition score is 3 for most donkeys.

    tips:
      - "Feed concentrates in small amounts, multiple times daily"
      - "Always introduce new feeds gradually"
      - "Provide salt/mineral supplements as needed"
      - "Monitor weight changes regularly"

  - id: "water-requirements"
    title: "Water Requirements"
    introduction: "Clean, fresh water is absolutely essential for donkey health and must be available at all times."
    content: |
      Donkeys can drink 15-30 liters of water per day, depending on their size, the weather, and their diet. Water requirements increase significantly in hot weather or when eating dry feed.

    care_items:
      - term: "Daily Water Intake"
        definition: "15-30 liters per day (more in hot weather or when eating dry feed)"
      - term: "Water Quality"
        definition: "Clean, fresh, free from algae and contamination"
      - term: "Container Requirements"
        definition: "Large enough for the donkey to drink comfortably, cleaned regularly"

    tips:
      - "Check water sources daily"
      - "Clean water containers regularly"
      - "Ensure water doesn't freeze in winter"
      - "Monitor intake - sudden changes can indicate health issues"

    warnings:
      - title: "Water Quality"
        content: "Contaminated water can cause serious illness. Always provide clean, fresh water."
