      AgentType: frontend-engineer
      Dependencies: []
      Description: Implement the useProduct hook that takes a product slug as parameter
        and returns the matching product from the mock data. The hook should search
        through the products array and find the product with matching slug. Return
        null if no product is found. This hook will be used by the ProductDetailPage
        to fetch product data based on URL parameters.
